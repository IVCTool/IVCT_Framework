= Future enhancements

Topics that might be adressed in the future to make the framework more comfortable

* Markers for logging (By using slf4j markes there could be a better separation between "protocol logging" and logging for maintenance reasons (error/exception logging)
* gradle based runtime configurations (it should be possible to create launch configurations for eclipse from within the gradle build)
* Use AMQP instead of JMS
* use some plugin mechanism for loading test case classes over special classloader
* Interoperability Badge based test case selection
