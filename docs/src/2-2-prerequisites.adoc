== Prerequisites for participating in the IVCT_Framework development or Testsuite development

To participate in the development you need:

* a personal GitHub account (this will have to be added to a ICTool team by one of the projects owners)
* a computer with internet access (for checking out and commiting code from/to GitHub)
* Java knowledge (since the framework is currently developed with Java)
* docker knowledge, as this is the recommended runtime infrastructure. 

== Proxies
If your computer sits behind some proxy you might need to ask your IT-department for the exact settings to configure for GitHub, gradle and eclipse to reach the internet.
