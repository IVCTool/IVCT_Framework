== Test Suite Overview

The test suites are the containers for the test cases verifying the interoperability requirements. A test suite is provided as a git repository following the structure of the tutorials test suite link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HelloWorld[TS_HelloWorld]. In order to use a test suite, it need to be integrated into the run-time configuration of the IVCTool, and a badged need to be included, containing an interoperability requirements which is being tested by test cases contained in such a test suite.


=== Available Test Suites

The following test suites are available for the IVCTool integration:

|===
| Test suite id | Test Purpose | Contributor

| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HelloWorld[TS_HelloWorld] | Tutorial test suite | DEU
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HLA_BASE/tree/master/TS_CS_Verification[TS_HLA_Verification] | This test case is equivalent to the "FCTT_NG" configuration verification step. | FRA
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HLA_BASE/tree/master/TS_HLA_Declaration[TS_HLA_Declaration] | This test case verifies that the federate only publishes and subscribes objects, interactions and attributes specified in its SOM. | FRA
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HLA_BASE/tree/master/TS_HLA_Services[TS_HLA_Services] | This test suite verifies that the federate uses only the services specified in its SOM. | FRA
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HLA_BASE/tree/master/TS_HLA_Object[TS_HLA_Object] | This test suite verifies that the federate sends and receives only the objects and interactions specified in its SOM. | FRA
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_HLA_BASE/tree/master/TS_HLA_EncodingRulesTester[TS_HLA_EncodingRulesTester] | This test suite will test whether a System Under Test (SUT) correctly encodes the data types used in interaction parameters or object attributes. | DEU

=== Test Suites under Development

Some test suites are currently under development any not yet integrated into any production release of the IVCTool.

|===
| Test suite id | Test Purpose | Contributor

| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_EntityIntegrityChecker[TS_EntityIntegrityChecker] | The test validates the integrity of Base Entities instances published by the System under Test | CAN
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_DeadReckoning[TS_DeadReckoning] | Implements the Dead Reckoning test case. | UK
| link:https://github.com/IVCTool/TS_Warfare[TS_Warfare] | Implements the Warfare test cases, namely WeaponFire and MunitionDetonation. | UK
